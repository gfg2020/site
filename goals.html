											<h3>"GFG is eradicating
systemic barriers to equitable career development
and advancement in the tech industry for young
women of color."</h3>
											<p>GFG is excited to engage Baltimore City College High School – CITY, as the first Pipeline to Pathways (P2P) partner! We are very much looking forward to engaging with BCC students, administrators and the larger CITY community in these enriching experiences. Details of the pilot program are the initial development stages. We’ve outlined for the school the program’s primary objectives</p>

                      <p>The organization, founded to address the persistent lack of sustainable opportunities and equitable advancement for women of color in technology, focuses its efforts on educating and training junior and senior high school students and college-aged young women of color.</p> 
                      
                      <p>The organization has stablished programming that will:
                      <ul type="disc">
                      <li>Expose both groups to entrepreneurs and business owners of color to industry experts and champions of social mobility, equity and advancement for young women of color.</li>
                      <li>Establish a sustainable pipeline to pathway (P2P) workforce development program in partnership with tech companies and STEM-focused organizations, to ensure high school and college students have internship and employment opportunities.</li>
                      <li>Educated young women by providing resources, programming and mentorship on the benefits of mental health and how it impacts overall performance and enhances opportunities for long-term physical, mental, emotional, and psychological success.</li>
                      <li>Using quantitative and qualitive data and analytics, track DP2P participants in order to build a bridge of understanding and accountability with a focus on metrics, to influence partner companies systemic and cultural organizational development to ensure success for participants.</li>
                      </ul>
